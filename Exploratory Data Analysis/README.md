This project will show you the exploration of dataset (Amazon Top 50 Bestselling Books 2009 - 2019). I got this dataset on Kaggle website. The exploration will be in a systematic way, a task that statisticians call exploratory data analysis.

The Questions that I am generated about the dataset are:
- Who is the author who got the highest rating from 2009 to 2019, and what is the book?
- In each year, who is the author who got the highest rating, and what is the book?
- Who is the author has written the most bestseller books from 2009 to 2019?
- In each year, who is the author has written the most bestseller books?
- Which book has the most reviews from 2009 to 2019?
- In each year, which book has the most reviews?
- Which genres become bestsellers more often?
- In each year, which genres become bestsellers more often?

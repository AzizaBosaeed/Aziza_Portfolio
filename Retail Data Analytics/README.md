# Project 1: Retail Data Analytics
In this project, I worked on sales dataset from Kaggle. It's about 45 stores located in different regions, and each store contains a number of departments. the dataset contain two tables (stores table and sales table). Stores table has three columns (store_id, type and size of store). Sales table has four columns (store_id, Dept_id, Date "by week", Weekly_Sales, IsHoliday "whether the week is a special holiday week").

The dashboard gives lots of informatiomn, for example:
- Total sales according to the filters.
- Which departments made top sales on holidays.
- Sales by top 10 departments in the company on all holidays or specific holiday.
- Which store made top sales on holidays.
- Sales by top 10 stores on all holidays or specific holiday.

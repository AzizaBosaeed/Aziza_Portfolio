# [Project 1: Retail Data Analytics](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMDEyNDYwNDItMTUzNC00ZDgzLWIzMmQtNzJhN2Q4ZDg0NTFiIiwidCI6IjJkMzE5NGUzLTE2NTQtNDZiZC1iYWUyLWFkMzdiYTExYjBhZSIsImMiOjl9)
In this project, I worked on sales dataset from Kaggle. It's about 45 stores located in different regions, and each store has a number of departments. the dataset contains two tables (stores table and sales table). Stores table has three columns (store_id, type and size of store). Sales table has four columns (store_id, Dept_id, Date "by week", Weekly_Sales, IsHoliday "whether the week is a special holiday week").

The dashboard gives a lot of informatiomn, for example:
- Total sales according to the filters.
- Which departments made top sales during the holidays?
- Sales by top 10 departments in the company based on all holidays or specific holiday.
- Which store made top sales during the holidays?
- Sales by top 10 stores based on all holidays or specific holiday.
- What is the holiday has the biggest sales?

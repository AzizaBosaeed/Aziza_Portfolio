# **Project 4: Users Interested in Free Samples**

This project was requested by a company about users interested in free sample distribution. The aim of this project is to generate an overview about the company users and build ML model for fill missing data. The dataset that I got from this company contains 2601 rows and 19 columns. 
In this project, I used:
* [Microsoft Excel to prepare the dataset by using power query.](https://github.com/AzizaBosaeed/Aziza_Portfolio/tree/main/Users%20Interested%20in%20Free%20Samples/Dataset)
* [Microsoft Power BI to visualize an overview for the company users.](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNWJkNGZiMjUtN2M2My00NzhhLTg3NzgtYTI1NTNkZjdjMDg0IiwidCI6IjJkMzE5NGUzLTE2NTQtNDZiZC1iYWUyLWFkMzdiYTExYjBhZSIsImMiOjl9)
* [Google Colab notebook to fill missing data in two ways by using python language.](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oA-lithnoyfqKOgd4uOGru5-PrYeYYKU?usp=sharing)
